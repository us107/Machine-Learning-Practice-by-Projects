# Regression
Regression in machine learning is a supervised learning technique used to predict continuous, numerical output values (e.g., prices, temperature, sales) based on the relationship between input features (independent variables) and a target variable (dependent variable).

## Most Important Models

Linear / Ridge / Lasso
Used for baselines, interpretability, fast iteration

Random Forest Regression
Handles non-linear patterns well

Gradient Boosting (XGBoost / LightGBM)
Industry standard for tabular data

SVR
Used when data is small but high-quality
